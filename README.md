## Project Details

In this project, I created a website using pure HTML, CSS, and JS. Here are some brief details about the website:
- You can refer to the images I used throughout the website, they're in the `static/images` folder.
- The icons used in the website are taken from `FontAwesome` and `iconscout.com`.
- I used `JavaScript` for the following sections of the website:
  - User/Admin current detail cards
    - I created an array of objects, each containing the details of each card.
    - Then, I used the `map()` function to create a reusable card for each of them.
  - Table that shows the services done by the user/admin
    - Similarly, I created an array of objects for the `services table` too.
    - Then, I created a reusable container for each service.
